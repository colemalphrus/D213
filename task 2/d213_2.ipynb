    "Data and Rational:\n",
    "The data that will be used for this analysis is \"sentiment labeled sentences\" dataset which can be found at the link bellow. This data set provides a sentence representing a review along with a label of 1 or 0 indicating a positive or negative sentiment respectively\n",

    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to determine the feasibility of using a natural language processing neural network to determine a customers sentiment based on a review. The determination of feasibility will be made by creating a NLP model using Tensorflow. The objective of this model is to be able to take in the review text data and determine if the review has a positive or negative sentiment. \n",
